## Deploy

### Netlify

1. Clone the project locally and add to your Github
1. Add the repo to Netlify

or

1. Click deploy to Netlify on the example repo

## ‚öôÔ∏è Netlify settings

In order to make sure our deck deploys properly using continuous integration, we
have to configure Netlify to build and display our app.

Go to your Deploy Settings (under the Deploys tab in your Netlify project/repo)
and add the following settings:

1. Set the build script to `npm run build`
1. Set the deploy folder to `dist`

We give Netlify a build script to run each time we make a commit to the repo.
And the deploy folder is the place where mdx-deck exports the static HTML/JS
version, and by pointing Netlify there it displays our deck after building.
