Tips, tricks to improve the performance of your react app

## What this talk is _not_

- Some other thing
- And this thing

---

### Let's get started

---

## The production build

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>
			By default, React includes many useful warnings for development. However,
			they make React larger and slower.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use the [production
			version](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build)
			when you deploy the app.
		</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

## Code splitting

- Loading less code will speed up your app
- Dynamic imports in React with `<React.Suspense />` and `React.lazy()`
- Eager loading for better UX
- Prefetch dynamic imports using
  [webpack magic comments](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments)
- Determine the need of code splitting with the
  [coverage feature of the developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage)

## Code splitting demo

import { LazyLoad } from './components/lazy-load';

<LazyLoad />

---

## Memoize expensive calculations

---

## Avoid unndecessary re-renders

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>Optimze slow renders before fixing [re-renders](https://a.com)</li>
		<li>Immutability and reference equality</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

## Viewport based rendering

---

## Performance death

---

## Bundling and minification

---

import { Highlighter } from './components/highlighter';

<Highlighter>
	{`
    export const hello = 'hi';
    const foo = 'bar';
    <h1 className="text-sm">Hello My Name lorem ipsum</h1>
  `}
</Highlighter>

---

export default Invert;

# Inverted BG

---

export default Split;

<Highlighter>
	{`
    const code = {
      example: ['one', 'two'],
    };
    
    <Button>Beep</Button>
`}
</Highlighter>

## Split layout

---

export default FullScreenCode;

<Highlighter>{`<Button>Beep</Button>`}</Highlighter>
